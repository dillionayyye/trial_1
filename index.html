      The FTX fraud stuff is already bad, but only gets worse when you start diving into
      their personal lives. I think what makes it even worse it that this is the future ruling class:
      A bunch of polyamours degenerates who, through either narcissicm or disability, delude themselves
      into viewing themselves as a tortured genius instead of nerd who was born into the right family with 
      the right connections. 
    </p>
    
    
    
      <p>
      The steady transition of the ruling class from recognizably evil old guys, titans 
      of industry who use their power to crush and manipulate the rest of us, to pale, skinny shut-in nerds
      makes me so goddamnned angry I cannot even put into words. You expect me to bow down...to HIM????

    <p>Russia says that the U.K was, in some capacity, 
      responsible for the Nord Stream pipeline getting blown up. 
      My first guess was the Polish, tbh. Why
      would any European state blow the pipeline? Germany's committment 
      must've begun to waiver, and blowing the pipeline was a way of saying 
      "you don't have a choice to but to stay the course". Scary stuff if you think about it.</p>
    
    <p2>The protests across Europe get next to no coverage. Seems like every week I get wind of a new one, 
      but virtually no coverage in Western media.
    </p2>
    
    <p>The U.S bitching about human rights and war crimes
      while having put up the most numbers is beyond parody. 
      War, and all the suffering that arises from it, is 
      and always will be indefensible. But really...
      the U.S leading the charge? That's the equivalent
      of the C.I.A saying "torture is bad". </p>
    
    <p>Anyone who is surprised about the West's support for 
      fascist / terrorist proxiesis just showing that they 
      haven't studied history. My favorite example is Gladio, the operation 
      in which the West, but principally the U.S. and U.K. trained and armed 
      fascists to disrupt the rise of a Post-WWII European left. And don't even get me 
      started on 80s Afghanistan and the Taliban.
    </p>
    
    <p>The Hunter Biden article that detailed his corruption and the 
      coordinated efforts of the State and Big Tech to kill that 
      story before the election was one of the boldest acts of
      partisianship I can think of. Dozens of C.I.A agents declared
      the story *Russian Disinformation* and then Twitter and Facebook
      blocked their users from sharing and linking it. Not one of those
      people faced consequences. Not one of those people was forced to
      apologize. And they never will. A government agency, taking it 
      upon itself to leverage it's prestige to suppress information
      that could impact how people vote. Is this not election interference?
      It was, but because they're the "good guys", it's ok. 
    </p>
    
    <p>The lamest political stunt that's been taking off as of recent
      is to crash these fundraisers and campaign speeches and shout about
      how those politicians are funding terrorism and pushing the world closer to 
      a larger, more disastrous conflict. While the protestors are correct,
      do you think it's gonna change anything? George Bush Jr gave an 
      interview somewhere and talked about the dangerous of misinformation
      like he didn't invade a country on a lie and kill a million people.
      Logic cannot beat someone who's illogical. With logic, you operate
      within the bounds of reason and objectivity. Those without logic, do not.
      The protestors also assume that telling the truth will change anything.
      The impenetrable defense of those types is decorum. If you're loud, you're 
      breaking decorum. If you're angry, you're breaking decorum. If you're agitated,
      you're breaking decorum. Watch any of those videos. The people who shut down the 
      protestors aren't usually security or staffers, but people in the crowd who take
      it upon themselves to restore order. It's quite funny actually.
    </p>
    
    <p>The people who funded jihadi terrorists are the same one's calling foreign 
      adversaries state-sponsors of terrorism. Remember the "moderate rebels" in Syria
      who engaged in ritualistic cannibalism? Or the "freedom fighters" in Libya who 
      established a open-air slave markets selling African migrants? It's almost like everyone
      is sponsoring terrorists to fight their battles or something.
    </p>
    
    <p>The State Department calling for freedom of speech and freedom of press while actively
      persecuting whistleblowers and blacklisting journalists who don't recite the right 
      lines is also very funny.</p>
    
    <p>The gullibilty of people is wild. The Democrats have been promising to codify Roe v. Wade
      for almost a decade. Maybe even longer. But they never will. If they codify it into law, 
      then they can't run on that platform anymore, can no longer dangle the carrot in front of the rabbit. 
      Same as the border. Neither party wants to actually solve the border issues because then 
      they can longer use it as a platform to run on or use to criticize their adversaries.
    </p>
    
    <p>All it took was a change in the Presidential adminstration to change the narrative regarding the border issue.
      In 2016-2020, the Trump policies (cruel and barbaric) were, to democrats, indistinguishable from that
      of Nazism. These policies were defended or ignored by Republicans. When Biden got into office, and these policies 
      remained largely the same, in some aspects worsed by the opening of more detainment facilities, Democrats ran defense
      of the policy and Republicans made those same vapid trips to those facilities in protest, the same one's they 
      defended just years prior. It's all so tiresome. Nobody care's about this people, but instead
      of solving the issue, they just lock them in cages and use them malign their political enemies. It's 
      so dehumanizing. 
    </p>
    
     <p>Anyone surprised by the defence mainstream media is running for the FTX ghouls clearly hasn't learned this undeniable fact:
       People in power don't suffer consequences. There were no consequences for the engineers of '08 financial crash,
       no consequences for the troves of leaked financial documents about offshore bank accounts by the world elite, and I highly doubt there
       will be any for FTX. 
    </p>
    
     <p>The Haitian struggle is one that will be won. The West has been conspiring to keep Haiti down since Haitian slaves
       liberated themselves. The West wants Haiti to remain a malleable island that they can exploit for it's labor. 
       For reference, look into the human rights abuses against haitian workers by American companies. Start with 'Levi's'
       and the threads will unravel themselves
    </p>
    
     <p>I literally remember where I was when the fake story about 'Russia paying the Taliban to kill American soldiers' dropped.
       It was everywhere for weeks and then, years later, they quietly admitted it was a lie. A false story, planted by the State, was amplified 
       by every major news network in the U.S. By the same news networks that actively employ former spies and feds from the various alphabet agencies.
