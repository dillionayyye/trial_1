    <p2>Bartering should make a comeback. I traded my barber a haircut for a new logo</p2>

      Is this a blog or a diary? idk. Prolly more a space to dump all the 
      thoughts and observations I can't do nun with
    </p>

      Wish I had a goldfish memory. I remember too much
    </p>
    <p>Maybe people would care more about Julian Assange if he could rap</p>
    
    <p>Not everybody is neurodivergent, some niggas is just crazy</p>

      People who use public restroom stalls and 
      play the audio from their phones out-loud are killers.

      Youtube is wild. Watch a few vids on exercise and calisthenics
      and next thing you know, your feed is full of borderline fascist shit</p>
    
    <p>I'm a "glass half full" kinda guy till a minor inconvience strikes</p>
    
    <p>Fuck WebMD, this is Healthline territory</p>
    
    <p>In real life, Doctor Strange woulda become a racist
      if his ex-boo got with a brotha</p>

    <p>Russia says that the U.K was, in some capacity, 
      responsible for the Nord Stream pipeline getting blown up. 
      My first guess was the Polish, tbh. But think about it. W
      hy would any European state blow the pipeline? Germany's committment 
      must've begun to waiver, and blowing the pipeline was a way of saying 
      "you don't have a choice to but to stay the course". Scary stuff if you think about it.</p>
    
    <p2>The protests across Europe get next to no coverage. Seems like every week I get wind of a new one, 
      but virtually no coverage in Western media.
    </p2>
    
    <p>The U.S bitching about human rights and war crimes
      while having put up the most numbers is beyond parody. 
      War, and all the suffering that arises from it, is 
      and always will be indefensible. But really...
      the U.S leading the charge? That's the equivalent
      of the C.I.A saying "torture is bad". </p>
