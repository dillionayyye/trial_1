      <span class="blink">Organized Thoughts</span>
    </h3>
    <p>Russia says that the U.K was, in some capacity, 
      responsible for the Nord Stream pipeline getting blown up. 
      My first guess was the Polish, tbh. But think about it. W
      hy would any European state blow the pipeline? Germany's committment 
      must've begun to waiver, and blowing the pipeline was a way of saying 
      "you don't have a choice to but to stay the course". Scary stuff if you think about it.</p>
    
    <p2>The protests across Europe get next to no coverage. Seems like every week I get wind of a new one, 
      but virtually no coverage in Western media.
    </p2>
    
    <p>The U.S bitching about human rights and war crimes
      while having put up the most numbers is beyond parody. 
      War, and all the suffering that arises from it, is 
      and always will be indefensible. But really...
      the U.S leading the charge? That's the equivalent
      of the C.I.A saying "torture is bad". </p>
    
    <p>Anyone who is surprised about the West's support for 
      fascist / terrorist proxiesis just showing that they 
      haven't studied history. My favorite example is Gladio, the operation 
      in which the West, but principally the U.S. and U.K. trained and armed 
      fascists to disrupt the rise of a Post-WWII European left. And don't even get me 
      started on 80s Afghanistan and the Taliban.
    </p>
    
    <p>The Hunter Biden article that detailed his corruption and the 
      coordinated efforts of the State and Big Tech to kill that 
      story before the election was one of the boldest acts of
      partisianship I can think of. Dozens of C.I.A agents declared
      the story *Russian Disinformation* and then Twitter and Facebook
      blocked their users from sharing and linking it. Not one of those
      people faced consequences. Not one of those people was forced to
      apologize. And they never will. A government agency, taking it 
      upon itself to leverage it's prestige to suppress information
      that could impact how people vote. Is this not election interference?
      It was, but because they're the "good guys", it's ok. 
    </p>
    
    <p>The lamest political stunt that's been taking off as of recent
      is to crash these fundraisers and campaign speeches and shout about
      how those politicians are funding terrorism and pushing the world closer to 
      a larger, more disastrous conflict. While the protestors are correct,
      do you think it's gonna change anything? George Bush Jr gave an 
      interview somewhere and talked about the dangerous of misinformation
      like he didn't invade a country on a lie and kill a million people.
      Logic cannot beat someone who's illogical. With logic, you operate
      within the bounds of reason and objectivity. Those without logic, do not.
      The protestors also assume that telling the truth will change anything.
      The impenetrable defense of those types is decorum. If you're loud, you're 
      breaking decorum. If you're angry, you're breaking decorum. If you're agitated,
      you're breaking decorum. Watch any of those videos. The people who shut down the 
      protestors aren't usually security or staffers, but people in the crowd who take
      it upon themselves to restore order. It's quite funny actually.
    </p>
    
    <p>The people who funded jihadi terrorists are the same one's calling foreign 
      adversaries sponsors of terrorism. 
    </p>
    
    <p>The State Department calling for freedom of speech and freedom of press while actively
      persecuting whistleblowers and blacklisting journalists who don't recite the right 
      lines is also very funny.</p>
