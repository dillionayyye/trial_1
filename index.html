    <p2>Bartering should make a comeback. I traded my barber a haircut for a new logo</p2>

      Is this a blog or a diary? idk. Prolly more a space to dump all the

    <p>Russia says that the U.K was, in some capacity, 
      responsible for the Nord Stream pipeline getting blown up. 
      My first guess was the Polish, tbh. But think about it. W
      hy would any European state blow the pipeline? Germany's committment 
      must've begun to waiver, and blowing the pipeline was a way of saying 
      "you don't have a choice to but to stay the course". Scary stuff if you think about it.</p>
    
    <p2>The protests across Europe get next to no coverage. Seems like every week I get wind of a new one, 
      but virtually no coverage in Western media.
    </p2>
    
    <p>The U.S bitching about human rights and war crimes
      while having put up the most numbers is beyond parody. 
      War, and all the suffering that arises from it, is 
      and always will be indefensible. But really...
      the U.S leading the charge? That's the equivalent
      of the C.I.A saying "torture is bad". </p>
